# APS---Project
# As part of my course Algorithmic problemSolving, I created a murder mystery game, consisting of three different mysteries.
# Each mystery could be solved by completing 3 different riddles. Player could use a maximum of 3 hints for the clues and an option of revealing the answer once throughout the game.
